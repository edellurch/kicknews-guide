# Embedding Videos

In order to be independent of other services, we decided to host small video clips ourselves. Here is a step-by-step guide to uploading a video to the Media Library and inserting it into an article.

## Limitations

The maximum length of a video clip is not limited, but we consider a **maximum length of 30 seconds** to be reasonable. The **maximum file size is 2.5 MB** per video. We only support videos in **MP4 format**.

- Recommended maximum length: `30 seconds`
- Maximum file size: `2.5 MB`
- Supportet file format: `.mp4`

## Video Editing Software

The choice of video software is left to the writer. However, care should be taken that no watermarks are visible on the videos. We recommend [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org) as free software. (Many thanks to Tim ‚ù§Ô∏è)

## 1. Reduce File Size

In order not to exceed the maximum file size, the videos have to be reduced and compressed. We use the free online service [videosmaller.com](https://www.videosmaller.com/).

#### Instructions

1. Select the video file.
2. Check `Use low compression level (best quality)`.
3. Set Scale to `Scale to 480 width`.
4. Check `Remove audio from video`.
5. Press `Upload Video`.

After the upload you should see a confirmation like this:

Here you can already make sure that the **maximum file size of 2.5 MB** is not exceeded. If this is the case, your video is probably too long or you have made the wrong settings.

6. Download the video file and switch to the Backend.

## 2. Upload Video File

Next, the video is uploaded to the media library in the backend.

#### Instructions

1. Log in to the backend and navigate to `Media Library`.
2. Click `Add new assets` from the right top corner.
3. Choose your video file(s) and press `Upload x asset(s) to the library`.

::alert{type="info"}
Make sure that your video has a meaningful file name.

4. Now you should see your uploaded file in the library, click on the entry. The file details will open. **Click on the link symbol** on the right above the image to copy the URL of the image to the clipboard, which you will need later to insert the video into the article.

## 3. Insert Video to an Article

Now that you have saved the URL of the video in your clipboard, we can insert the video into an article.

Unfortunately, direct insertion from the media library does not work, so we have to add the video manually.

#### Instructions

1. Open your article. Place the cursor where you want to insert the video.
2. Click on the 3 dots in the formatting bar and then on the "html" symbol to add custom html code.

3. Paste the following code and **replace the `PLACEHOLDER`** with the URL of the video file.

```html
<video autoplay loop muted>
  <source src="PLACEHOLDER" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

::alert{type="warning"}
Make sure that the quotes before and after the URL are preserved.
